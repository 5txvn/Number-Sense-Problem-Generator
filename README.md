# Number Sense Problem Generator
###### *By Steven Livingston*

## Background:

This project was made as my AP Computer Science Principles project, but I have long wanted to create a project like this and I have decided to continue it beyond simply just being an AP project into being something that not just future SEM students are able to use, but all students across all schools, to be able to learn how to do Number Sense for free. As someone who has been doing Number Sense for years now, one of the biggest problems that I have faced in actually teaching people Number Sense is the fact that the Number Sense tricks don't stick and there simply aren't enough practice problems out there to make tricks stick effectively, so you have to resort to making problems for yourself. I found this very inefficient and always thought that there was a better way to learn these tricks, and here we are. Enjoy the project!
